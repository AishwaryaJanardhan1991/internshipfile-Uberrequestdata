##  checking for some insights using SQL

-- 1) Checking the total number of requests(found 6745)
select count(*) as total_requests
from Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap;

-- 2)Request Count by Status(trip completed vs,cancelled, cars not available)
select Trip_status, count(*) as count
from Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap
group by Trip_status
order by count desc;

-- 3) Request Count by Pickup Point( based on airport and city)
select Pickup_point, count(*) as request_count
from Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap
group by Pickup_point;

-- 4) Trip Status breakdown by pickup point based on 3 status
select Pickup_point, Trip_status, count(*) AS count
from Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap
group by Pickup_point, Trip_status
order by Pickup_point, count desc;

-- 5)Trips Without Driver Assigned(No cars avalable)
select Trip_status, count(*) as no_driver_count
from Uber_Supply_Demand_Gap
where Driver_id is null
group by Trip_status;
